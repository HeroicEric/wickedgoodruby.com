        %h3.schedule-talk Creativity with Ruby-Processing
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#cheng'} Joanne Cheng
        %p.schedule-summary Many of us are developers working in great jobs that can, after a while, cause our minds to settle into habits. We work so hard to make deadlines that sometimes we forget to step out of our comfort zones. Enter Processing: Processing is a programming environment where developers can easily create images, animations, and visually interactive programs. A developer can break out of a rut by expressing themselves with beautiful interactions and visualizations through code. Out of the box, the Processing environment requires Java programming skills.
        %p.schedule-summary Ruby-Processing is a simple wrapper for the Processing framework that combines the visual-driven environment of Processing with the fun of writing Ruby. In this talk, we'll go through the ways to "sketch" with Ruby-Processing with several live coding examples and create something together. Through creativity, we can increase the breadth of problems we can solve in our day to day jobs.

        %h3.schedule-time 11a&ndash;12p
        %h3.schedule-talk Towards Tooling; A Look at What is Missing From Our Toolbox
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#segal'} Loren Segal
        %p.schedule-summary You can usually judge the maturity of a programming language ecosystem by the breadth of its tooling. For example, Java has a plethora of IDEs that each, in turn, have many well maintained refactoring and code quality plugins (like FindBugs and PMD). C/C++ is equally well established in this space. Even JavaScript is becoming well represented, with a number of static code analyzers and language supersets (like Dart and TypeScript) aimed at improving tooling in the language. But where is Ruby in all of this? This talk will shed some light on the existing tools available in the Ruby world as well as some new tools just starting to be built out in the areas of static analysis, formal verification, and code quality checking. We will look at what kind of tools the Ruby community is good at building, what kind of tools we are bad at, and most of all, some of the tooling we should be working on to really improve our ecosystem and drive more developers to this wonderful language.
      %li#scott
        %h3.schedule-time 12p&ndash;1p
        %h3.schedule-talk Escaping Reality With Shoes
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#scott'} Zachary Scott
        %p.schedule-summary Are you bored of hearing about Rails, Node, or Ember? Is your day job hacking on the same Rails app getting the best of you? Maybe you're looking for a fun way to get into this programming thing.
        %p.schedule-summary Let's imagine for a moment, your boss just gave you the day off because you've managed to squash the remaining bugs and shipped some invaluable features. With all of this free time there's so many options, what do you dooo? I know! You can build a game and experiment with some new code in the Magical Land of Shoes.
        %p.schedule-summary _why once said, "if you program and want any longevity to your work, make a game. all else recycles, but people rewrite architectures to keep games alive."
        %p.schedule-summary It's important to step out of your comfort zone and try something new! This talk will give you a whirlwind tour and cover the essentials that Shoes has to offer.
        %p.schedule-summary Together we can build a fun little game you can share with your friends, and inspire you to venture to places you're unaccustomed to.

        %h3.schedule-time 10a&ndash;11a
        %h3.schedule-talk Bloom: A language for disorderly distributed programming
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#meiklejohn'} Christopher Meiklejohn
        %p.schedule-summary Traditional programming languages use a model of computation where individual instructions are executed in order. However, when building distributed systems this model fails to match the reality of how your application code is actually executed. Bloom is a language which allows programmers to build applications as a series of unordered statements while also providing facilities for imposing a particular ordering of events when necessary.
        %p.schedule-summary During this talk we will explore building applications in Bud, which is a prototype of Bloom implemented as a domain specific language in Ruby. We will discuss the concepts of logical monotonicity, disorderly collections, the CALM principle which is the root of the Bloom language, and how to use he Bloom language to identify critical sections of your code where a coordiation library should be used to ensure consistency.
      %li#haddox
        %h3.schedule-time 11a&ndash;12p
        %h3.schedule-talk PEACE: Programming Expertly Amid Corporations & Enterprises
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#haddox'} Steven Haddox
        %p.schedule-summary Everyone casts the "Enterprise" as the most horrid place in the world to be a Ruby developer, and they used to be right. How does a Rubyist trying to stay current work in a confined and archaic environment with strict security restrictions? You do everything other Rubyists do, but you do it without sudo and from source. Together we'll identify the best open source self-hosted options for agile managment, provisioning, git hosting, error tracking, CI, isolated RVM, metrics, central logging, and security. As a bonus, you'll learn how to automate the setup of all these tools as much as possible without sudo privileges.
      %li#garber
        %h3.schedule-time 12p&ndash;1p
        %h3.schedule-talk Writing DSLs with Parslet
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#garber'} Jason Garber
        %p.schedule-summary A well-designed DSL improves programmer productivity and communication with domain experts. The Ruby community has produced a number of very popular external DSLs--Coffeescript, HAML, SASS, and Cucumber to name a few.
        %p.schedule-summary Parslet makes it easy to write these kinds of DSLs in pure Ruby. In this talk you’ll learn the basics, feel out the limitations of several approaches and find some common solutions. In no time, you’ll have the power to make a great new DSL, slurp in obscure file formats, modify or fork other people’s grammars (like Gherkin, TOML, or JSON), or even write your own programming language!

        %h3.schedule-talk MagLev: Ruby With an Image
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#baker'} Steven R. Baker
        %p.schedule-summary MagLev is a fast, stable, 64-bit open source implementation of the Ruby programming language.
        %p.schedule-summary MagLev offers a complete Ruby implementation, on a fast and solid VM, and includes a scalable object database. In this talk, you'll learn how to transparently store real objects, how to leverage fast and mature Smalltalk libraries in your Ruby applications, and how to deploy applications written on one of the most mature virtual machines in use today.
      %li#schneeman
        %h3.schedule-time 11a&ndash;12p
        %h3.schedule-talk Dissecting Ruby with Ruby
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#schneeman'} Richard Schneeman
        %p.schedule-summary Underneath the beautiful veneer of our Ruby libraries lies a twisted tangle of writhing guts. Maybe you're curious how the pieces fit together or maybe you're tracking down a bug, either way it's easy to get lost in the blood and bile that ties our code together. In this talk you'll learn how to use simple and sharp Ruby tools to slice into large libraries with surgical precision. Turn your impossible bugs into pull requests, and level up your programming skills by Dissecting Ruby with Ruby.
      %li#singh
        %h3.schedule-time 12p&ndash;1p
        %h3.schedule-talk ActiveRecord is still magical
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#singh'} Neeraj Singh
        %p.schedule-summary ActiveRecord is complex code and because of complexity it has edge cases. In fact lots of edge cases. We will take a look at a number of ActiveRecord features to see how it works and how to deal with some of the edge cases.
        %p.schedule-summary We will see how default_scope works. And why method "unscoped" removes default_scope from models but not from associations.
        %p.schedule-summary Do you know the difference between CollectionProxy and Relation ? Do you know why in a has_many through case "@physician.patients.create!" would work but "@physician.patients.where(active: true).create! would silently fail without creating the association record?
        %p.schedule-summary We will discuss why while patching Active Record you should run your tests against all three databases.
        %p.schedule-summary Guess which of these two obey :destroy option: @customer.orders.delete(@order) or @customer.orders.destroy(@order).
        %p.schedule-summary In Rails 3 when where conditions are merged then the last where condition wins. In Rails 4 all the where conditions are 'And'ed. But not defautl_scope. We will see how and why.
        %p.schedule-summary Will also discuss implementation detail of features like inverse_of, autosave and callbacks.
      %li#nicholaides
        %h3.schedule-time 10a&ndash;11a
        %h3.schedule-talk Securing Your Rails App
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#nicholaides'} Mike Nicholaides
        %p.schedule-summary How can you know if your Rails app is safe? With potential vulnerabilities lurking in your app's code, in gems you depend on, in services you use, and in the Rails source itself, attackers have myriad vectors to gain access to your data, interrupt your service, and damage your reputation.
        %p.schedule-summary In this talk, I'll cover the basics of securing your Rails app, evaluating and mitigating the risk inherent in live web applications, and strategies for keeping your app secure as new threats emerge.
      %li#gauthier
        %h3.schedule-time 11a&ndash;12p
        %h3.schedule-talk Outside-In Testing
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#gauthier'} Nick Gauthier
        %p.schedule-summary As a freelancer I'm often tasked with creating high quality web applications quickly while keeping the budget razor thin. In my experience, the absolute best bang-for-your-buck style of development has been BDD from the outside-in via acceptance tests. With acceptance tests you can quickly and accurately determine the minimum code necessary to fit the requirements of an application while achieving high code coverage and resilience to refactoring. By their very nature acceptance tests are the the simplest kinds of tests to write since they are expressed in the language of an end-user. In this talk we'll implement a feature from the outside-in, explaining the reasoning behind every step.
      %li#ballanco
        %h3.schedule-time 12p&ndash;1p
        %h3.schedule-talk RubyMotion: Under the Hood
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#ballanco'} Joshua Ballanco
        %p.schedule-summary By now you probably know that RubyMotion is a new toolchain that lets you use familiar Ruby techniques to develop applications for iOS...but do you know what makes it tick? How is RubyMotion different from toolchains such as PhoneGap or Titanium? What does it mean to say that RubyMotion is implemented "on top of the Objective-C runtime"? And how the heck do I debug RubyMotion anyway?
        %p.schedule-summary I will attempt to answer these questions, and more, by looking deep into the underpinnings of RubyMotion. Along the way, I'll give a bit of an overview of the history of RubyMotion, and maybe even a glimpse at its future.
      %li#menard
        %h3.schedule-time 10a&ndash;11a
        %h3.schedule-talk JRuby: Insights from Six Years in Production
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#menard'} Mark Menard
        %p.schedule-summary JRuby is the primary alternative implementation of Ruby available. With support for native threads, excellent garbage collection, and the introduction of Invoke Dynamic it has grown into a formidable platform. So, what can JRuby do for you? Learn how JRuby differs from MRI, how JRuby supports parallelism, how to use Java libraries from JRuby, how to use Ruby from Java and more. Java no longer means just the language anymore, the JVM is an excellent place to host Ruby applications.
      %li#campbell
        %h3.schedule-time 11a&ndash;12p
        %h3.schedule-talk Hacking Your Home with Ruby
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#campbell'} Justin Campbell
        %p.schedule-summary 15 years ago, Justin looked forward to the day when he could have a stack of expensive audio equipment with speakers in every room, lights that follow him around, and an intercom system so the family could page each other like Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.
        %p.schedule-summary Ubiquitous networking, APIs for consumer electronics, and cheap computers like the Raspberry Pi have made it easier than ever to automate your home. We go over some popular technologies, see some code to glue it all together, and watch a live demo of some of Justin's favorite house hacks.
      %li#stolfo
        %h3.schedule-time 12p&ndash;1p
        %h3.schedule-talk Thread Safety First
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#stolfo'} Emily Stolfo
        %p.schedule-summary We rubyists historically haven’t been in the habit of thinking about concurrency but the reality is that our thread-unsafe code often works by sheer luck. There are different implementations of Ruby with their own semantics that can unearth challenging and unexpected concurrency bugs in our code. We have to become more accustomed to writing threadsafe code in order to anticipate these potential surprises, especially in light of the rise in popularity of JRuby.
        %p.schedule-summary I will discuss approaches to writing threadsafe code in this talk, with a specific focus on performance considerations and testing. I'll start by explaining some basic concurrency concepts, describe methods for handling shared mutable data, and touch on the subtleties of concurrency primitives (Queue, ConditionVariable, Mutex). Hair-raising, real-world bugs will be used throughout the presentation to illustrate specific concurrency issues and techniques for solving them.

        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#alcorn'} Doug Alcorn
        %p.schedule-summary Ever wondered about market trading, analytics or algorithms but didn't want to lose your shirt experimenting? EVE Online is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) rich in data with a fully functional, player driven economy. Using some simple concepts and novel tools you can get access to this data and discover interesting things. This talk will introduce you to market analytics and the cruel world of EVE Online.
      %li#vargo
        %h3.schedule-time 11a&ndash;12p
        %h3.schedule-talk Using Ruby to Automate Your Life
        %a.schedule-speaker{:href => '/speakers#vargo'} Seth Vargo
        %p.schedule-summary You probably use Ruby everyday, so why not use Ruby to automate some common tasks? What if you could spin up an EC2 instance and have it automatically configure your web server, database, users, and more? What if you could effectively capture and replicate your production environments reliably and consistently? What if you could then give developers production-like environments as Virtual Machines, with no additional work? What if you could set up your new laptop with multiple Ruby versions, your favorite software, and even change the desktop background - from a single command? The good news is - you can!
        %p.schedule-summary Chef is a configuration management and automation tool that solves these problems and many more. In this talk, you'll learn common just how easy it is to capture your infrastructure in Chef. Save time and money by using Chef's Ruby DSL to "define" your laptop.
        %p.schedule-summary How many times have you bought a new laptop and realize just how much stuff you installed over the years? If you're using Chef, run a single command and all your favorite Applications, Preferences, and even passwords are back in place. And the best part - because Chef is written in Ruby, you get to continue using the language you love!

        %p.schedule-summary With several spawling, monolithic Rails apps under my belt, I had the opportunity to go a different route. Bulging models, obtuse controllers, and views chock full of logic were my world. When I came up for air, all the cool kids were writing thick clients with svelte backends. Perhaps Sinatra and some hip Javascript framework were the way? Here's what I learned...
