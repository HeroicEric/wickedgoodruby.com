            %h3.schedule-talk People Patterns
            %h3.schedule-speaker Joe O'Brien
        %p.schedule-summary We spend a large portion of our time thinking about code and technical project issues. What about the people side of things? The majority of project failures occur because of people, not technology. What we need are guides that help us navigate the waters between the people around us.

            %h3.schedule-speaker Heather Rivers
        %p.schedule-summary Once the realm of shadowy government organizations, cryptography now permeates computing. Unfortunately, it is difficult to get correct and most developers know just enough to be harmful for their projects. Together, weâ€™ll go through the basics of modern cryptography and where things can go horribly wrong.

            %h3.schedule-talk Go Ahead, Make a Mess
            %h3.schedule-speaker Steven Ragnorok
        %p.schedule-summary Square manages big data, high uptime, secure payment info and large teams in an agile Rails environment. It's hard. Our system has outgrown the patterns of a young Rails app and some of what used to help has started to hurt. It's painful to have your email templates in the same project as your API backend. It's agonizing to use your main datastore for analytics, and it hurts to throw code into ./lib or require unnecessary gems. This talk is about how we've turned individual Rails pieces into separate services and scaled our codebase, data, and integration testing practices to support multiple big teams efficiently.
